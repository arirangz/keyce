          Coffee is a drink prepared from roasted coffee beans. Darkly colored,
          bitter, and slightly acidic, coffee has a stimulating effect on
          humans, primarily due to its caffeine content. It is the most popular
          hot drink in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seeds of the Coffea plant's fruits are separated to produce unroasted
          green coffee beans. The beans are roasted and then ground into fine
          particles that are typically steeped in hot water before being
          filtered out, producing a cup of coffee.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          According to one legend, ancestors of today's Oromo people in a region
          of Jimma in Ethiopia were the first to recognize the energizing effect
          of the coffee plant. However, no direct evidence has been found
          earlier than the 15th century indicating who among the African
          populations used it as a stimulant, or where coffee was first
          cultivated. The story of Kaldi, the 9th-century Ethiopian goatherd who
          discovered the stimulating effect of coffee when he noticed how
          excited his goats became after eating the beans from a coffee plant,
          did not appear in writing until 1671 and is probably apocryphal

        <h2>Biology</h2>
        <p>
          Several species of shrub of the genus Coffea produce the berries from
          which coffee is extracted. The two main species commercially
          cultivated are Coffea canephora (predominantly a form known as
          'robusta') and C. arabica.[37] C. arabica, the most highly regarded
          species, is native to the southwestern highlands of Ethiopia and the
          Boma Plateau in southeastern Sudan and Mount Marsabit in northern
          Kenya.[38] C. canephora is native to western and central Subsaharan
          Africa, from Guinea to Uganda and southern Sudan.[39] Less popular
          species are C. liberica, C. stenophylla, C. mauritiana, and C.
          racemosa.

        <h2>Processing</h2>
        <h3>Roasting</h3>
        <p>
          The next step in the process is the roasting of green coffee. Coffee
          is usually sold in a roasted state, and with rare exceptions, such as
          infusions from green coffee beans,[90] coffee is roasted before it is
          consumed. It can be sold roasted by the supplier, or it can be home
          roasted.[91] The roasting process influences the taste of the beverage
          by changing the coffee bean both physically and chemically. The bean
          decreases in weight as moisture is lost and increases in volume,
          causing it to become less dense. The density of the bean also
          influences the strength of the coffee and the requirements for
          packaging.
        </p>

        <h3>Grading roasted beans</h3>
        <p>
          Depending on the color of the roasted beans as perceived by the human
          eye, they will be labeled as light, medium light, medium, medium dark,
          dark, or very dark. A more accurate method of discerning the degree of
          roast involves measuring the reflected light from roasted seeds
          illuminated with a light source in the near-infrared spectrum. This
          elaborate light meter uses a process known as spectroscopy to return a
          number that consistently indicates the roasted coffee's relative
          degree of roast or flavor development.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="upper-text">
          Coffee is often consumed alongside (or instead of) breakfast by many
          at home or when eating out at diners or cafeterias. It is often served
          at the end of a formal meal, normally with a dessert, and at times
          with an after-dinner mint, especially when consumed at a restaurant or
          dinner party.
        </p>
        <p>
          A coffee break in the United States and elsewhere is a short
          mid-morning rest period granted to employees in business and industry,
          corresponding with the Commonwealth terms "elevenses", "smoko" (in
          Australia), "morning tea", "tea break", or even just "tea". An
          afternoon coffee break, or afternoon tea, often occurs as well.
